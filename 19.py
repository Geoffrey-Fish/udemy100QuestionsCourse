'''Add a new pair of key c and value 3 to the dictionary and print out the new dictionary like this:
    {"a":2,"c":3,"b":2}'''

d = {"a":1,"b":2}

d["c"] = 3
print(d)

#Here I learned that the order is irellevant, dicts are an unordered bunch(at least in the course.Afaik they are now ordered too since 3.8
